# LangChain Hello World Example

A minimal example demonstrating how to use LangChain to create a simple conversational agent. This example shows the basic concepts of LangChain including creating a conversational agent, using tools, handling conversations, and basic error handling.

> Note: LangChain agents will continue to be supported, but it is recommended for new use cases to be built with LangGraph. LangGraph offers a more flexible and full-featured framework for building agents, including support for tool-calling, persistence of state, and human-in-the-loop workflows.

## âš¡ Quick Start (5-Minute Setup)

1.  Install dependencies:
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Set up environment:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` with your settings:
```ini
# LLM Model configurations
DEFAULT_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
DEFAULT_TEMPERATURE=0.7

# OpenAI API configurations
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
OPENAI_API_BASE=https://api.openai.com/v1  # Optional: custom API endpoint (e.g. for API proxies)
```

3. Run the example:
```shell
python helloworld.py
```

4. Expected output:
```
